# Priority Folders - ONLY these folders will be processed
# Comma-separated list. Default folders are:
# ~/Screenshots/, ~/Downloads/, ~/Documents/, ~/Pictures/
# 
# You can customize this list to focus on specific directories:
# PRIORITY_FOLDERS=~/Desktop/,~/Projects/,~/ImportantFiles/
#
# Note: The script now ONLY processes these priority folders for performance.
# This avoids scanning your entire home directory which could take hours.
